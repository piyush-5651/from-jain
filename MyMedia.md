I'm big fan of anime my favorite anime is ***One Piece*** It's a pirate store about finding a big treasure. In the complete Luffy the led character made a lots of friends and travelled complete Grand Line. This series first show aired in August 1999 and It is still in run. This was Number one show for couple of years and there is only one write for this anime.
