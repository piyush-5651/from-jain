### Pappu Dhaba Restaurant and Hotel
I like this restaurant because me and my friends used to go there and spent good time. The food was very delicious and wide range of options are available. The ***quantity of the food*** was good enough for a big group. The ***ambiance of restaurant is really amazing*** during the rainy season.
